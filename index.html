            <p>Hello, hello, hello! My name is Tyler and I'm excited to have made this,
            the first legit webpage of my life! A few things about me: I grew up in Utah and love to travel,
            play sports, and play the piano. There are six kids in my family, and I aspire to be the favorite uncle
            to five beautiful nieces and nephews.
            <br><br>
            I graduated from Brigham Young University with an economics degree, which taught me that money
            flows to things that are in high demand.
            Hence, here I am, learning how to code! I'm excited to learn more!</p>
